SOME of the code files we have made have extra useless code that we used as after making the submission file we tried to make changes further but werent satisfied with the results.
OUR Team has made many models and at the end what we did is that we combined all the output in the csv files and took the average of our model output and then took the result of the averages and made it into csv files getting final output.
